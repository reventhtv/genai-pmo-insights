The project is facing increased delivery risk this week.

The external payments vendor has still not provided final API
approval despite multiple follow-ups. As a result, UAT start
dates are now at risk and a schedule rebaseline may be required.

Engineering teams continue to operate under sustained workload
pressure. While no attrition concerns exist, fatigue is becoming
visible and sprint predictability has reduced.

Leadership attention may be required if vendor approval is not
secured immediately.
