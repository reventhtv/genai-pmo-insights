Overall progress remains on track.

The external payments vendor has now provided formal API approval, and
integration activities are progressing as planned. The previous dependency
risk has been resolved, and no further impact to the UAT timeline is expected.

The engineering team workload has stabilized following reprioritization,
and team morale has improved.

We will continue to monitor delivery closely, but no immediate risks
require escalation at this time.
