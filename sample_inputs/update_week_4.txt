Overall project outlook has improved this week.

The external payments vendor has provided final API approval,
allowing integration and UAT activities to proceed as planned.
No further schedule impact is expected from this dependency.

Engineering workload has normalized following reprioritization
of deliverables. Team morale and predictability have improved.

No risks require escalation at this stage.
