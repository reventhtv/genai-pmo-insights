Project progress continues, however some concerns have emerged.

Approval from the external payments vendor has been delayed beyond
the originally agreed timeline. If approval is not received within
the next week, integration testing may be impacted.

Engineering workload has increased due to parallel priorities.
While delivery continues, sustained pressure may begin to affect
predictability and morale.

Escalation may be required if vendor timelines slip further.
