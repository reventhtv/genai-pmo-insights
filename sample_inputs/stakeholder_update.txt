Overall progress is on track, however there are some emerging concerns.
The integration with the external payments vendor is taking longer than
expected due to delayed feedback on API changes.

The engineering team is currently managing multiple parallel deliverables,
which has started to impact morale and sprint predictability.
There is also a risk that the current delay may affect the UAT timeline
if vendor approval is not received within the next two weeks.

We are monitoring the situation closely and exploring mitigation options.
