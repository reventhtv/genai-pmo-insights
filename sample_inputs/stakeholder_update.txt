Overall progress remains broadly on track, however there are a few items
that may require leadership attention if not addressed promptly.

The integration with the external payments vendor continues to be delayed.
Despite multiple follow-ups, formal approval on the revised API contract
has not yet been received. If approval is not secured by the end of next
week, the UAT timeline will be impacted and a schedule rebaseline may be
required.

The engineering team is currently handling multiple parallel deliverables
across programs. While delivery is continuing, sustained workload pressure
is beginning to impact morale and sprint predictability. This risk should
be monitored closely over the next two sprints.

At this stage, escalation may be required if vendor approval timelines
slip further or if delivery capacity constraints persist.
