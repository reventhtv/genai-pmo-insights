Overall project progress is on track this week.

The integration with the external payments vendor is ongoing.
Initial discussions have been positive, however formal API approval
is still pending. No immediate impact is expected at this stage.

The engineering team is working across multiple deliverables but
capacity remains manageable. Team morale appears stable.

No major risks require escalation at this point.
