GenAI-Powered PMO Insights Dashboard (GPMOID)

🧠 GenAI PMO Insights (GPMOID)

GenAI PMO Insights is a lightweight, privacy-first dashboard that converts raw stakeholder updates into actionable PMO signals — executive-ready communication, early warnings, and prioritized risks.

Unlike generic AI summarizers, this tool is designed around how PMOs actually operate: signal detection, risk management, predictability, and decision support.

✨ What This Tool Does

Given a plain-text stakeholder update, the system:

Generates an executive-ready email (subject + body)

Extracts early warning signals
(Delay, Cost, Morale, Dependency, Risk)

Identifies and structures project risks

Description

Category (Schedule, Cost, People, Quality, Risk)

Severity (Low / Medium / High)

Presents insights in a clear, review-ready dashboard

🧠 Why This Exists

In real projects:

Stakeholder updates are noisy and unstructured

Risks are discovered too late

PMOs spend time rewriting, not analyzing

This project explores how GenAI can assist PMOs by:

Surfacing weak signals early

Making risk discussions explicit

Supporting structured, repeatable decision-making

🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project uses a hybrid AI architecture designed for reliability and predictability.

Hybrid LLM Strategy

Primary path: Uses an LLM to analyze stakeholder updates

Fallback path: Deterministic, rule-based output when LLMs fail or are unavailable

This mirrors real enterprise expectations — AI systems must degrade gracefully.

High-Level Flow

User uploads a .txt stakeholder update

Analysis service invokes LLM (if available)

Structured insights are generated as JSON

Streamlit UI renders:

Email preview

Warning signals

Risk summary table

🔐 Privacy & Data Handling

This tool is privacy-first by design:

No database

No user accounts

No file storage

No retention of stakeholder updates

All processing happens in-memory during a session.

📦 Tech Stack

Python

Streamlit – UI & interaction

OpenAI API – LLM-based analysis

Pydantic – Structured outputs

Pandas – Tabular risk display

▶️ Running Locally
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/genai-pmo-insights.git
cd genai-pmo-insights

2️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Set environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"


(On Windows, use set instead of export)

4️⃣ Run the app
streamlit run app.py

🧪 Sample Input

A sample stakeholder update is provided under:

sample_inputs/stakeholder_update.txt


You can use this to quickly explore the tool without creating your own input.

🧩 PMBOK Alignment (Conceptual)

The insights generated by this tool align with common PMO responsibilities:

Risk Management – risk identification & prioritization

Stakeholder Management – sentiment and communication clarity

Schedule & Cost Control – early warning signals

Governance – structured, repeatable outputs

This project is intentionally methodology-aware, not methodology-heavy.

🚀 Roadmap Ideas

Potential future enhancements:

Risk trend analysis across multiple updates

Sentiment scoring over time

Severity-weighted risk heatmaps
